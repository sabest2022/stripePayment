Stripe Payment App
A simple web application that allows users to make payments using Stripe. The application includes a basic header with a checkout button, which upon being clicked will initiate the Stripe payment process.

Features:
Integration with Stripe for handling payments.
Uses Stripe webhooks to manage payment events and store order details.
Provides user feedback for expired sessions and login requirements.
Prerequisites:
Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

Node.js and npm (You can download them from here)
Git (You can download it from here)
Installation & Setup:
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Stripe-payment-app.git
cd Stripe-payment-app
Replace your-username with your GitHub username and Stripe-payment-app with your repository's name if it's different.

Install Dependencies:
Navigate to the server directory and install the required packages.

bash
Copy code
cd server
npm install
Environment Variables:
Set up your environment variables. You'll need to create a .env file in your server directory and configure it with your Stripe API keys and any other necessary information.

Example .env configuration:

makefile
Copy code
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_stripe_public_key
Replace your_stripe_secret_key and your_stripe_public_key with your actual Stripe keys.

Running the App:
In the server directory, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will start the server. Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the app.

Usage:
Initiate Payment:
Click on the Checkout! button in the header to initiate the payment process.

Handle Payment:
Upon clicking the checkout button, the application will communicate with the Stripe API to create a payment session and redirect the user to the Stripe payment page.

Webhooks:
The app listens to Stripe webhooks for various events, such as successful payments or payment creation. When a payment event occurs, the app handles it accordingly and may store relevant order details.

Session Expiry:
If a user's session has expired or the user is not logged in, they will be alerted and redirected to the login page.
